Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up. \n \n\"We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours. \n \n\"It's generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month's meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards.\" \n \nHe said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them. \n \nMr Carney said: \"They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made.They even put 'reserved for the armed forces'. \n   Promoted stories   \nThe reserve veteranwith the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home. \n \nHe was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany. \n \nMr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces. \n \nThe Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink. \n \nThe management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub. \n   \n Share article  \n   \nThe next meeting is at the Postal Order on Saturday, October 3 at 10am. \n \nThe breakfast club meets on the first Saturday of each month for those who want to attend in future.","title":"Worcester breakfast club for veterans gives hunger its marching orders","media-type":"News","source":"Redditch Advertiser","published":"2015-09-07T10:16:14Z"},
